# liri-node-app

### Overview

In this assignment, I will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a **Language** Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

The User should type the following choices in the command line:

    *concert-this - "with the follow of artist or band name after it"

    *spotify-this-song - "with the follow of song name here"

    *movie-this - "with the movie name after it"

    *do-what-it-says - just will run 'spotify-this-song' for the song name from 'random.txt' file
